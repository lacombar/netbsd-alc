.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a general purpose resource allocator.
Despite its name, it can be used for arbitrary resources
other than virtual memory.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh CODE REFERENCES
This section describes places within the
.Nx
source tree where actual code implementing the
.Nm
subsystem can be found.
All pathnames are relative to
.Pa /usr/src .
.Pp
The
.Nm
subsystem is implemented within the file
.Pa sys/kern/subr_vmem.c .
