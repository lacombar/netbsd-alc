.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
.Nm
is a driver for the IDEC Supervision/16, an image capture board
that plugs into a 16-bit ISA bus.
The IDEC Supervision/16 digitizes an NTSC television signal, storing
a 512 x 480-pixel, 8-bit grayscale image in its 256kB dynamic RAM array
every 1/30th of a second.
The host reads frames from the DRAM using 122881 16-bit I/O reads.
Reading frames from the Supervision/16 is quite slow:
after the host reads a 16-bit word from the DRAM, the Supervision/16
state machine takes approximately 0.5 microseconds to get ready
for the next read.
Theoretically, a frame rate of approximately 10 frames per second
is possible.
.Nm
achieves a frame rate of approximately 6 frames per second.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device first appeared in
.Nx 5.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An David Young Aq dyoung@NetBSD.org .
.Sh BUGS
.Pp
Synchronizing with the hardware and reading frames from it is very
CPU-intensive.
.Pp
.Nm
will not detect the capture board if it is not attached to an active
video source.
To force
.Nx
to detect the capture board at any time, re-scan the ISA bus using,
e.g.,
.Ic drvctl Fl r Ar isa0 .
