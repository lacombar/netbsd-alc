.Sh NAME
.Nm aiboost
.Nd ASUS AI Booster hardware monitor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "aiboost* at acpi?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for monitoring the hardware sensors in recent
.Tn ASUS
motherboards.
The driver uses ACPI as the backend to fetch sensor values and
descriptions and provides its data via the
.Xr envsys 4
interface.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver typically has 7 sensors, depending on the motherboard and
chipset:
.Bl -column "Sensor" "Units" "Typical" -offset indent
.It Sy "Sensor" Ta Sy "Units" Ta Sy "Typical Use"
.It Li "CPU" Ta "uK" Ta "CPU Temperature"
.It Li "MB" Ta "uK" Ta "MB Temperature"
.It Li "VCC" Ta "uV DC" Ta "Core Voltage"
.It Li "+3.3V" Ta "uV DC" Ta "+3.3 Voltage"
.It Li "+5V" Ta "uV DC" Ta "+5 Voltage"
.It Li "+12V" Ta "uV DC" Ta "+12 Voltage"
.It Li "CPU" Ta "RPM" Ta "CPU Fan"
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr envsys 4 ,
.Xr envstat 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Fx
and then it was ported to
.Nx 5.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Takanori Watanabe
and
.An Juan Romero Pardines ,
who adapted the code for
.Nx .
.Sh BUGS
It's possible to modify voltages via the ACPI methods in the DSDT,
but for now the driver only reports the sensors' values.
CPU Q-Fan is another thing that is typically specified in the ACPI
namespace, and in the future we should handle this feature (to
enable or disable automatic/manual fan mode).
