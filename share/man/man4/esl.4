.Sh NAME
.Nm esl
.Nd ESS Technology AudioDrive (Programmed I/O mode) family audio device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "esl*   at pcmcia? function ?"
.Cd "audio* at audiobus?"
.Cd "opl*   at esl?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the ESS 1688 AudioDrive audio devices on a
PCMCIA card.
.Pp
Since there is no way to do DMA over the PCMCIA bus, the
.Nm
driver uses a Programmed I/O mode to drive the cards. This is very
inefficient, but is the only way to drive such a card.
.Pp
Cards supported by this driver are capable of 8- and 16-bit audio sample
playback at rates up to 44.1kHz.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr midi 4 ,
.Xr opl 4 ,
.Xr pcmcia 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Jared D. McNeill Aq jmcneill@invisible.ca
.Sh BUGS
Putting a machine into suspend mode while this driver is active will
cause the machine to freeze.
.Pp
Recording is not yet supported by this driver.
