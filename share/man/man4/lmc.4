.Sh DESCRIPTION
.\"
This is an open-source
.Tn Unix
device driver for PCI-bus wide-area network interface cards.
It sends and receives packets
in HDLC frames over synchronous circuits.
A computer plus
.Ux
plus some
.Tn LMC
cards makes an
.Em open
wide-area network router.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver works with
.Tn FreeBSD ,
.Tn NetBSD ,
.Tn OpenBSD ,
.Tn BSD/OS ,
and
.Tn Linux
OSs.
It has been tested on
.Tn i386
(SMP 32-bit little-end),
.Tn PowerPC
(32-bit big-end),
.Tn Alpha
(64-bit little-end), and
.Tn Sparc
(64-bit big-end) architectures.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver works with the following cards:
.Bl -tag -width "LMC5200" -offset indent
.It Sy LMC5200
HSSI\[em]High Speed Serial Interface,
.Bd -unfilled -compact

0 to 10 Mb/s, DTE or DCE.

T1/E1, RJ45 conn, 100 or 120 ohms,
.Bd -unfilled -compact
T1-B8ZS-ESF, T1-AMI-SF, E1-HDB3-many,
DSX-1 up to 1500 ft; CSU up to 6 Kft.
.Ed
.El
.Pp
.Tn LMC
cards contain a high-performance
.Sy PCI
interface, an
.Sy HDLC
function and
either integrated
.Sy modems
(T1, T3) or
.Sy modem
interfaces (HSSI and SSI).
.Bl -tag -width "Modem" -offset indent
.It Sy PCI
The PCI interface is a
.Tn "DEC 21140A Tulip"
Fast Ethernet chip.
This chip has an efficient PCI implementation with scatter/gather DMA,
and can run at 100 Mb/s full duplex (twice as fast as needed here).
.It Sy HDLC
The HDLC functions (ISO-3309: flags, bit-stuffing, CRC) are implemented
in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) which talks to the Ethernet
chip through a Media Independent Interface (MII).
The hardware in the FPGA translates between Ethernet packets and
HDLC frames on-the-fly; think of it as a WAN PHY chip for Ethernet.
.It Sy Modem
The modem chips are the main differences between cards.
HSSI cards use ECL10K chips to implement the EIA-612/613 interface.
T3 cards use a
.Tn TranSwitch TXC-03401
framer chip.
SSI cards use
.Tn Linear Technology LTC1343
modem interface chips.
T1 cards use a
.Tn BrookTree/Conexant/Mindspeed Bt8370
framer and line interface chip.
.El
.Pp
Line protocol stacks exist above device drivers
and below internet protocol stacks.
They typically encapsulate packets in HDLC frames and deal with
higher-level issues like protocol multiplexing and security.
The driver is compatible with several line protocol stacks:
.Bl -tag -width "GenericHDLC" -offset indent
.if \n[fbsd] \{\
.It Sy Netgraph
.Xr Netgraph 4
implements many basic packet-handling functions as kernel loadable modules.
They can be interconnected in a graph to implement many protocols.
Configuration is done from userland without rebuilding the kernel.
ASCII configuration control messages are
.Em not
currently supported. \}
.if \n[fbsd] \{\
.It Sy SPPP
.Xr sppp 4

.if (\n[nbsd] : \n[obsd]) \{\

.if \n[linux] \{\
.It Sy GenericHDLC
implements Synchronous-PPP, Cisco-HDLC, Frame-Relay,
Ether-in-HDLC, IPv4-in-HDLC, and X.25 in the kernel.
.It Sy SyncPPP

GenericHDLC uses SyncPPP as it's in-kernel PPP implementation. \}
.It Sy RawIP
The null line protocol, built into the driver, sends and receives
raw IPv4 and IPv6 packets in HDLC frames with no extra bytes of
overhead and no state at the end points.

Testing with loopbacks requires only one card and
can test everything on that card.
Packets can be looped back at many points: in the PCI chip,
in the modem chips, through a loopback plug, in the
local external equipment, or at the far end of a circuit.
.Pp
All cards can be looped through the PCI chip.
Cards with internal modems can be looped through
the modem framer and the modem line interface.
Cards for external modems can be looped through
the driver/receiver chips.

.Ss Packet Lengths
.\"
.Bd -unfilled -compact
Maximum transmit and receive packet length is unlimited.
Minimum transmit and receive packet length is one byte.
.Ed
.Pp
Cleaning up after one packet and setting up for the next
packet involves making several DMA references.
This can take longer than the duration of a short packet,
causing the adapter to fall behind.
For typical PCI bus traffic levels and memory system latencies,
back-to-back packets longer than about 20 bytes will always
work (53 byte cells work), but a burst of several hundred
back-to-back packets shorter than 20 bytes will cause packets
to be dropped.
This usually is not a problem since an IPv4 packet header is
at least 20 bytes long.
.Pp
The device driver imposes no constraints on packet size.
Most operating systems set the default Maximum Transmission
Unit (MTU) to 1500 bytes; the legal range is usually (72..65535).
This can be changed with
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent -compact

.An Ron Crane
had the idea to use a Fast Ethernet chip as a PCI interface
and add an Ethernet-to-HDLC gate array to make a WAN card.
.An David Boggs
designed the Ethernet-to-HDLC gate array and PC cards.
We did this at our company,
.Tn "LAN Media Corporation (LMC)" .
.Tn "SBE Corporation"
aquired
.Tn LMC
and continues to make the cards.
.Pp
Since the cards use Tulip Ethernet chips, we started with
.An Matt Thomas Ns '
ubiquitous
.Xr de 4
driver.
.An Michael Graff
stripped out the Ethernet stuff and added HSSI stuff.
.An Basil Gunn
ported it to
.Tn Solaris
(lost) and
.An Rob Braun
ported it to
.Tn Linux .
.An Andrew Stanley-Jones
added support for three more cards.
.An David Boggs
rewrote everything and now feels responsible for it.
