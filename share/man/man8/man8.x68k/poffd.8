.Dt POFFD 8 x68k
.Sh NAME
.Nm poffd
.Nd x68k shutdown daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar shutdown-program
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
looks at the power switch of x68k.
When the switch is turned off,
.Nm
executes
.Ar shutdown-program
(using
.Pa /bin/sh -c ) .
.Pp
If the system is started by x68k's RTC timer,
.Ar shutdown-program
is executed when the system's shut down time (predefined using
other utility, SX-Window Control Panel and
.Xr rtcalarm 8
for example) arrives.
.Pp
The argument
.Ar shutdown-program
may contain the character `%'. It is substituted with a number
which indicates the way how the system was started:
.Bl -tag -width xxx -compact -offset indent
.It 0
Front power switch
.It 1
External (I/O slot) power signal
.It 2
RTC alarm
.El
.Pp
This is useful when choosing the shutdown message.
.Pp
If the argument
.Ar shutdown-program
is omitted,
.Sq Ic /sbin/shutdown -r +1
is executed instead.
